### **Backend Plan for Password Manager**

---

### **1. User Authentication**
- **User Registration**:  
  - Accept email, password, and 2FA (optional) during registration.
  - **Hash** passwords with **bcrypt** before storing in the database.
  
- **User Login**:
  - Validate user credentials (email/password).
  - If valid, generate a **JWT token** and send it to the frontend for session management.
  
- **2FA** (optional for added security):
  - Send a **2FA code** to the user via email or an authenticator app.
  - Validate the 2FA code during login.
  
- **Session Management**:  
  - Use **JWT** for maintaining user sessions (store in the frontend).
  - Implement **token expiration** and **refresh** tokens.

---

### **2. Password Management**
- **Create a Password**:  
  - Accept password details (title, website, username, password) from the frontend.
  - **Encrypt the password** before storing it in the database (use **AES-256** or a similar algorithm).
  
- **Retrieve Passwords**:  
  - Fetch passwords for the authenticated user from the database.
  - **Decrypt** passwords when they are retrieved (only on the backend) before sending them back to the frontend.

- **Edit Password**:  
  - Accept updated password details.
  - Re-encrypt the password and store it in the database.
  
- **Delete Password**:  
  - Delete the password entry from the database securely.

- **Password Vault**:  
  - Provide an endpoint to fetch the entire list of stored passwords for the authenticated user (paginated if necessary).

---

### **3. GitHub Scanning Feature**
- **GitHub OAuth**:  
  - Implement **OAuth2** to allow users to log in with their GitHub credentials.
  - Use the **GitHub API** to fetch repositories that the user owns or has access to.

- **Scan Repositories for Exposed Secrets**:  
  - Use **GitHub API** to fetch the content of the files in the repositories.
  - Apply **regex patterns** to detect exposed secrets (API keys, database passwords, etc.).
  - Common regex patterns for detecting secrets:
    - API_KEY=...
    - DB_PASSWORD=...
    - secret_key=...
  
- **Store Scan Results**:  
  - Store the scan results in the database (repo name, file name, line numbers of detected secrets).
  - Provide an endpoint to retrieve scan results for the frontend.

- **Notifications**:  
  - Notify users if new secrets are found after a scan (via email or through the app).

---

### **4. Data Storage and Security**
- **Database**:  
  - Use a secure relational database like **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL** to store:
    - **User information** (email, hashed password, 2FA secret).
    - **Passwords** (title, website, username, encrypted password).
    - **GitHub scan results** (repo name, file names, line numbers).
  
- **Encryption**:  
  - Encrypt passwords using **AES-256** before storing them in the database.
  - Use **RSA** or another secure algorithm to encrypt data in transit.
  - Implement **end-to-end encryption**: The backend never stores the plaintext passwords, and decryption only happens on the frontend.

- **Rate Limiting**:  
  - Implement **rate limiting** for APIs (e.g., for login attempts, password creation, GitHub scanning) to prevent abuse.

---

### **5. API Design**
- **Authentication APIs**:
  - **POST /auth/signup**: Register a new user.
  - **POST /auth/login**: Authenticate and generate a JWT token.
  - **POST /auth/verify-2fa**: Verify the 2FA code during login.
  
- **Password Management APIs**:
  - **GET /passwords**: Get the list of passwords (paginated).
  - **POST /passwords**: Create a new password (encrypted).
  - **PUT /passwords/{id}**: Edit an existing password (re-encrypted).
  - **DELETE /passwords/{id}**: Delete a password.

- **GitHub Scanning APIs**:
  - **GET /github/repos**: Get a list of repositories for the authenticated user.
  - **POST /github/scan**: Trigger a scan for exposed secrets in selected repositories.
  - **GET /github/scan-results**: Fetch the results of the scan (e.g., list of exposed secrets).

---

### **6. Security**
- **HTTPS**:  
  - Use **HTTPS** for all API communications to protect data in transit.

- **Token Security**:  
  - Store **JWT tokens** securely on the frontend (preferably in memory or secure storage).
  - Implement **token expiration** and **refresh tokens** for better security.

- **Input Validation**:  
  - Sanitize all inputs to prevent **SQL injection** and **XSS** attacks.

- **Audit Logs**:  
  - Optionally, log significant actions such as login attempts, password creation, and GitHub scans for security monitoring.

---

### **7. Notifications and Feedback**
- **Email Notifications**:  
  - Notify the user when:
    - A new password is added/updated.
    - A GitHub scan detects secrets.
    - Passwords need to be updated (if reused or weak).
  
- **Success/Error Responses**:  
  - Always return clear success/error responses from API endpoints.
  - Use HTTP status codes appropriately (e.g., 200 for success, 400 for bad request, 401 for unauthorized).

---

### **8. Additional Features (Future)**
- **Backup & Recovery**:  
  - Provide a way to **export passwords** securely or back them up in case of data loss.
  
- **Multi-account support**:  
  - Allow users to manage multiple password vaults if needed (optional feature).

---

### **Technologies to Use**:
- **Backend Framework**: Django (with Django REST Framework) or Flask for Python.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL/MySQL.
- **Authentication**: JWT + 2FA (using libraries like PyOTP for TOTP).
- **Encryption**: PyCryptodome or a similar encryption library.
- **GitHub API**: Use Pythonâ€™s **requests** or **PyGitHub** for interacting with GitHub.
